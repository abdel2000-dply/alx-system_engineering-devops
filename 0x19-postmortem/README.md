# Incident Postmortem Report

## Issue Summary:

**Duration:**
- Start Time: December 15, 2023, 2:00 PM (UTC)
- End Time: December 15, 2023, 4:30 PM (UTC)

**Impact:**
- The e-commerce platform experienced a service outage during a peak shopping season.
- Users could not access the website, resulting in a significant loss of potential sales and customer frustration.
- Approximately 40% of users were affected.

**Root Cause:**
- An unforeseen surge in traffic, combined with unnoticed performance degradation in a critical payment processing service, led to a server overload and subsequent outage.

## Timeline:

**2:00 PM:**
- Traffic surge begins as users flock to the platform for holiday shopping.
- Performance degradation in the payment processing service starts.

**2:30 PM:**
- Monitoring alerts triggered for increased response times and error rates.
- Initial assumption: Network issues due to the traffic spike.

**3:00 PM:**
- Investigation focuses on network infrastructure. No issues found.
- Misleading path: Initial belief that increased traffic alone caused the slowdown.

**3:30 PM:**
- Outage detected as the payment processing service fails to handle incoming requests.

**4:00 PM:**
- Root cause identified: Performance degradation in the payment processing service due to increased load.
- Corrective actions initiated, including scaling up server capacity and optimizing code.

**4:30 PM:**
- Service was gradually restored, with full functionality returning by the end of the outage.

## Root Cause and Resolution:

**Root Cause:**
- Unnoticed performance degradation in the payment processing service, exacerbated by the unexpected surge in traffic.

**Resolution:**
- Immediate scaling up of server capacity to handle increased load.
- Code optimizations implemented to enhance the efficiency of the payment processing service.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

**Improvements/Fixes:**
- Implement automated scaling mechanisms to dynamically adjust server capacity during traffic spikes.
- Conduct regular load testing to identify potential bottlenecks before peak periods.

**Tasks:**
- Implement a comprehensive review of critical services to identify performance bottlenecks.
- Enhance communication protocols for incident response to ensure faster escalation and resolution.

We are committed to providing a seamless shopping experience for our customers, especially during critical periods.
